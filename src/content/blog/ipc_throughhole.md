Most through hole components are defined by either lead diameter or recommended hole size. IPC-221 has guidance on how to size the footprint to allow for reliable soldering. I lead the team to develop a python app to do the calculations to save me from grabbing the calculator whenever I needed to design a footprint. The download link is at the bottom.
